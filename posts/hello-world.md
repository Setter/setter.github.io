The Setter Engineering team is delighted to announce a new space to share ideas and announcements.

Relative to the size of the company, we're a much smaller group. As of this writing, the Engineering Team is comprised of myself as a half engineer / half manager, 3 full-time full-stack engineers and 2 part-time engineers.

With that said, we have begun an aggressive hiring effort to grow the team. By the end of 2019, we should be at around 10 or more full-time engineers.
